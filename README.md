I miss the old GitHub, simple menu's GitHub
Filled with the juice, GitHub, set on they goals, GitHub
I hate the new GitHub
The bad UI GitHub, Copilot in the news GitHub
I miss the small GitHub, code with Ruby GitHub
I'd like to say, at the time, I'd like to meet GitHub
See, I wish I invented GitHub, there was only one GitHub
I used to love GitHub, I used to love GitHub
I even had that shi on Rails, I thought I was GitHub
What if GitHub made a blog post about GitHub
Called "We miss the old GitHub," man that'd be so GitHub
That's all I was GitHub, we still love GitHub
And I love you like GitHud loves GitHud
